Potentially Viable Strategies:
 * Rush
   + Early upgrades with not great follow up
   + Early upgrade synergy which plateaus (flat numbers for example)
   + Instantly gain a bunch of each resource
   + Overclock
   + Intercept
 * Contain
   + Something like siege tanks - maybe planetary weapons
 * Fast Expand
 * Quick Tech
 * Turtle
   + mining rate, but - mining rate for each planet
   + building grant more hp
 * Battleships
 * Bomber Strat
 * Midrange / "Macro"
   + stacking cross-upgrade synergies

upgrade ideas:
rush:
-ships move faster when flying to enemy planets
-upgraded when alone
-fighter centric
-atomic bomb
-degrade with number of planets
-upgrade is on a timer
turtle:
-bonus when ships are docked
-planetary weapon
-bonus but slow down ships
-ship siege mode when defending
-line between nearby planets as defense
-create hazards
-unstable reactor
fast expand:
-static resource bonus based on number of planets  
-population bonus with fighter sacrifice
-add a defense building to existing planets
-fighters move faster when going to allied planets
quick tech:
-trade iron for other resource
-battleship-related
-interceptor ability like corsair
-this strategy is implicit more or less
macro:
-scaling ship improvements
-iron production  
-upgrade synergy lines
-balance across upgrades

many ofthese ideas have drawbacks, but opportunity cost may be sufficient
