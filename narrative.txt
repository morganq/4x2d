narrative:
Federation led by the Censors
who were able to divide and rule all the known civilizations because of their control over time
humanity did not bow down because of millenia history of struggle, and ignorance of the true power of the censors
become a symbol of resistance over the course of a game
final boss is a censor "control station" 
[Censors trapped some humans here in a time loop; free them and they will help you win the level]
[time nodes or w/e that you have to destroy. maybe a new time crystal resource?]


The Network - creators are long gone and unknown...  but maybe an ancient human [capitalist] project.
 - Downfall: Upon seeing the Censors' ability, The Network spontaneously arrived at a decision. Submit rather than face certain extinction. All properly functioning devices voted yes. 

Barysi - Extremely high energy civilization which rapidly burns through rare minerals and must move on.
 - Downfall: The Censors chose not to fight, but to use their power to trick their diplomats and foment internal war. 
             Exhausted with their deeply fractured society, a final congress was held which disbanded the traditional social structure and handed the reigns of power to the Censors.
             
Void Keepers - Discovered the void. Keepers understand it only in ritualistic terms, not scientifically. But the power of the void is vast.
 - Downfall: A long battle. The void provided cover and strength, but the Censors were resilient, their army endlessly refreshed and saved by time manipulation. The keepers know
             better and more deeply than anyone, that you cannot win against the Censors.
