variations:
 - tendency to rush
 - interest in defending planets being attacked
 - hyperfocus on one target
 - expansionary vs. making ships vs. making buildings

alien ideas:
 - borg: ship that can convert your ships
 - klingon: cloaked ships
 - empire: space weapon / building that fires a laser at planets
 - ?: good against fighters (fast-recharging small shield)
 - indigenous: colonization starts off with some set of buildings
 - ?: shield blocks the first damage, with cooldown
