Possibilities:
- Lose access to a portion of your planets. Keep everything else.
- Full reset, keep just the last planet
- Partial reset, keep technologies
  - So, lose access to all ships other than fighters, have to rebuild
  - Between levels you gain special techs that you otherwise do not have access to
  - Get rid of tech upgrades in game and make them only at the end?
- Partial reset: random selection about what to keep:
  - Star systems with Memory Crystal reward: Keep 2 technologies researched
  - Warp Field reward: Start each level with the ships from a production order
  - Miniaturization reward: Colonist ships bring a building along with them
  - Alien Insights reward: Improve 2 upgrades.


Concept:
Alien invasions have scattered humanity across the stars.
You detect a distress signal from a distant galaxy...
Standing between you and your goal are lightyears of alien-infested star systems
