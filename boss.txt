for difficulty: long and multi-stage fight

- Time prison objects (planet-like). Every <x> time, they freeze everything around them permanently. Destroy to stop the effect and free everything.
- Win this part 1, and mothership arrives to reverse a number of planets' deaths and restore them.
- Reviver ships. Revives all nearby x seconds after the last unit dies. Doesn't fly all they way to target, but sort of floats around
