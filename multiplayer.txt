Refactor game states.
Two types of state:
1. "Game state" - The game is in exactly one of these at any given time
    a. Intro - show level name or w/e.. maybe 3,2,1 countdown
    b. Game - everything really
    c. Victory - who won

2. "Player input state" - Each player has their own input state
    a. MapState - the neutral main state
    b. PreparingOrderState - when dragging the arrow
    c. OrderShipsState - when picking the number of ships to go to each place
    d. UpgradeState - selecting which upgrade to get
    e. PickUpgradeTargetState - self-explanatory




Game
 - player_inputs[]
 - game loop
   - input -> figure out which player -> call scene's take_input passing the playerinput object

Scene
 - in_game_players[]

PlayerInput
 - id = player 1, player 2, etc.

InGamePlayer
 - id, matching playerinput. could even hold on to the playerinput object?
 - player_input_state
