Cascading Stats:
Stats class
instance of it on each upgrade.
civ has get_stat fn which looks at each upgrade on the civ
building has get_stat fn which looks at its upgrade
planet has get_stat fn which calls get_stat on each building

When a ship calculates stats, it looks at its owning civ's stats
When a planet calculates stats, it looks at its building, planet, and civ stats and adds them.

The only thing upgrades do is have stats and optionally take one-time actions.

Many stats are used whenever the relevant thing is calculated. Bullets will check the shooter's civ's damage stat.
Some stats do something per-frame or whatever. That can be just in a big conditional in the civ, or in the planet, or in the building or w/e.
